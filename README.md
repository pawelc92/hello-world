# hello-world
First hello-world repository on GitHub

Hello everyone! I'm Pawe≈Ç and I'm writing the message because GitHub guide told me I should do it... So I did, I have written very simple, boring and the shortest message people ever seen. But it's only a lesson how to use GitHub.

Thanks for your attention... Guys :)
